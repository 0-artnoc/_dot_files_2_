# TODO: install mp3splt
# For splitting an audiobook into pieces, so that you can use the seek bar
# sanely, `mp3splt` can be used in one run pretty much at the disk's speed. Its
# format language for metadata is atrocious, but thankfully putting the result
# into a script frees me from revisiting the horror.
#
# Here's the command I use to cut into 10-minute pieces without a 1-minute
# piece hanging at the end, and to name and title the pieces sequentially—so
# you can be spared the ordeal:
#
#   mp3splt -t '10.00>2.00' -o '@f @n2' -d . -g 'r%[@o,@N=1,@t=#t @N]' "$1"
#
# where $1 is the source file, and `.` is the current directory as the
# destination.
#
# IIRC it also comes with oggsplt and flacsplt—but no such luck for aac or ac3.
