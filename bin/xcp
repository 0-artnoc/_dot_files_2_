# Simple script to copy to X11 clipboard. Uses xsel if available, and falls
# back to xclip. xsel is preferred because I found that copying using xclip
# and pasting into certain textareas (gmail, google docs) resulted in all
# newlines being stripped. But using xsel worked correctly.
#
# Similarly, we configure neovim to use xsel if available.
