# This command creates a temporary directory, copies cdiff to it as diff and
# then adds that temporary directory to the leading part of PATH. In effect,
# this causes the sub-command executed to use `delta` for diffing. We do this
# because always using delta doesn't seem to work (e.g., `pass` breaks).
